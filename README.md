# ID3--decision-tree-algorithm
Implemented Decision Tree model on data with binary parameters using ID3 and Variance Impurity heuristic for selecting the next attribute to split on, and optimized the generated tree by Post pruning to get an accuracy of 77%
Here there are tow types of datasets. Training and testing in binary format.
Decision tree implemented using Information Gain heuristic and Impurity Variance. Also implemented post pruning algorithm. 
The output is in Tree form. 
The Final Accuarcy is around  72 and after pruning the accruacy is 78.
